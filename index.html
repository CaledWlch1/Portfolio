        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have two years of education in Computer Science, which has given me a strong foundation in programming 
            and software development. During this time, I have gained basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
             allowing me to create simple and responsive web pages. My understanding of HTML includes structuring content 
             properly using semantic elements, while in CSS, I have worked with styling techniques such as flexbox, 
             grid, and responsive design to enhance user interfaces.<br><br>
    
             In JavaScript, I have learned how to add interactivity to web pages using DOM manipulation, event handling, 
             and basic functions. Although I am still improving my JavaScript skills, I am familiar with fundamental 
             concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and basic API integration.<br><br>
            
             Additionally, I have a basic understanding of Java, where I have worked with object-oriented programming concepts 
             like classes, objects, and methods. I have also experimented with simple Java applications, focusing on logical structures, 
             loops, and conditional statements. While my experience with Java is still at the beginner level, I am continuing to learn and 
             improve my understanding of the language.<br><br>
            
             At this stage, I am focused on strengthening my front-end development skills and gaining more hands-on experience with building 
             interactive web pages. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and eventually explore back-end development to become a 
             more well-rounded developer.
